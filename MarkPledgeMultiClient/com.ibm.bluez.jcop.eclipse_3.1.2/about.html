International License Agreement for Non-Warranted Programs<br>
<br>
Part 1 - General Terms<br>
<br>
BY DOWNLOADING, INSTALLING, COPYING, ACCESSING, OR USING 
THE PROGRAM YOU AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU 
ARE ACCEPTING THESE TERMS ON BEHALF OF ANOTHER PERSON OR A 
COMPANY OR OTHER LEGAL ENTITY, YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU 
HAVE FULL AUTHORITY TO BIND THAT PERSON, COMPANY, OR LEGAL 
ENTITY TO THESE TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, <br>
<br>
- DO NOT DOWNLOAD, INSTALL, COPY, ACCESS, OR USE THE 
PROGRAM; AND<br>
<br>
- PROMPTLY RETURN THE PROGRAM AND PROOF OF ENTITLEMENT TO 
THE PARTY FROM WHOM YOU ACQUIRED IT TO OBTAIN A REFUND OF THE 
AMOUNT YOU PAID. IF YOU DOWNLOADED THE PROGRAM, CONTACT THE PARTY 
FROM WHOM YOU ACQUIRED IT.<br>
<br>
"IBM" is International Business Machines Corporation or one 
of its subsidiaries.<br>
<br>
"License Information" ("LI") is a document that provides 
information specific to a Program. The Program's LI is available at 
http://www.ibm.com/software/sla/ . The LI may also be found in a 
file in the Program's directory, by the use of a system command, 
or as a booklet which accompanies the Program.<br>
<br>
"Program" is the following, including the original and all 
whole or partial copies: 1) machine-readable instructions and 
data, 2) components, 3) audio-visual content (such as images, 
text, recordings, or pictures), 4) related licensed materials, 
and 5) license use documents or keys, and documentation.<br>
<br>
A "Proof of Entitlement" ("PoE") is evidence of Your 
authorization to use a Program at a specified level. That level may be 
measured, for example, by the number of processors or users. The PoE 
is also evidence of Your eligibility for  future upgrade 
prices, if any, and potential special or promotional opportunities. 
If IBM does not provide You with a PoE, then IBM may accept 
the original paid sales receipt or other sales record from the 
party (either IBM or its reseller) from whom You acquired the 
Program, provided that it specifies the name of the Program and the 
usage level acquired. <br>
<br>
"You" and "Your" refer either to an individual person or to 
a single legal entity.<br>
<br>
This Agreement includes Part 1 - General Terms, Part 2 - 
Country-unique Terms (if any), License Information, and Proof of 
Entitlement and is the complete agreement between You and IBM regarding 
the use of the Program. It replaces any prior oral or written 
communications between You and IBM concerning Your use of the Program. The 
terms of Part 2 and License Information may replace or modify 
those of Part 1. To the extent there is a conflict between the 
terms of this Agreement and those of the IBM International 
Passport Advantage Agreement, the terms of the latter agreement 
prevail.<br>
<br>
1. Entitlement<br>
<br>
License<br>
<br>
The Program is owned by IBM or an IBM supplier, and is 
copyrighted and licensed, not sold.<br>
<br>
IBM grants You a nonexclusive license to use the Program 
when You lawfully acquire it.<br>
<br>
You may 1) use the Program up to the level of use specified 
in the PoE and 2) make and install copies, including a backup 
copy, to support such use. The terms of this license apply to 
each copy You make. You will reproduce all copyright notices and 
all other legends of ownership on each copy, or partial copy, 
of the Program.<br>
<br>
If You acquire the Program as a program upgrade, after You 
install the upgrade You may not use the Program from which You 
upgraded or transfer it to another party.<br>
<br>
You will ensure that anyone who uses the Program (accessed 
either locally or remotely) does so only for Your authorized use 
and complies with the terms of this Agreement.<br>
<br>
You may not 1) use, copy, modify, or distribute the Program 
except as provided in this Agreement; 2) reverse assemble, reverse 
compile, or otherwise translate the Program except as specifically 
permitted by law without the possibility of contractual waiver; or 3) 
sublicense, rent, or lease the Program.<br>
<br>
IBM may terminate Your license if You fail to comply with 
the terms of this Agreement. If IBM does so, You must destroy 
all copies of the Program and its PoE.<br>
<br>
Money-back Guarantee<br>
<br>
If for any reason You are dissatisfied with the Program and 
You are the original licensee, You may obtain a refund of the 
amount You paid for it, if within 30 days of Your invoice date You 
return the Program and its PoE to the party from whom You obtained 
it. If You downloaded the Program, You may contact the party 
from whom You acquired it for instructions on how to obtain the 
refund.<br>
<br>
Program Transfer<br>
<br>
You may transfer a Program and all of Your license rights 
and obligations to another party only if that party agrees to 
the terms of this Agreement. When You transfer the Program, You 
must also transfer a copy of this Agreement, including the 
Program's PoE. After the transfer, You may not use the Program.<br>
<br>
2. Charges<br>
<br>
The amount payable for a Program license is a one-time 
charge. <br>
<br>
One-time charges are based on the level of use acquired 
which is specified in the PoE. IBM does not give credits or 
refunds for charges already due or paid, except as specified 
elsewhere in this Agreement.<br>
<br>
If You wish to increase the level of use, notify IBM or the 
party from whom You acquired it and pay any applicable charges. <br>
<br>
If any authority imposes a duty, tax, levy or fee, 
excluding those based on IBM's net income, upon the Program, then You 
agree to pay the amount specified or supply exemption 
documentation. You are responsible for any personal property taxes for the 
Program from the date that You acquire it.<br>
<br>
3. No Warranty<br>
<br>
SUBJECT TO ANY STATUTORY WARRANTIES WHICH CAN NOT BE 
EXCLUDED, IBM MAKES NO WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS EITHER EXPRESS OR 
IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR 
CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND 
NON-INFRINGEMENT, REGARDING THE PROGRAM OR TECHNICAL SUPPORT, 
IF ANY.<br>
<br>
The exclusion also applies to any of IBM's Program 
developers and suppliers.<br>
<br>
Manufacturers, suppliers, or publishers of non-IBM Programs 
may provide their own warranties.<br>
<br>
IBM does not provide technical support, unless IBM 
specifies otherwise.<br>
<br>
4. Limitation of Liability<br>
<br>
Circumstances may arise where, because of a default on 
IBM's part or other liability, You are entitled to recover 
damages from IBM. In each such instance, regardless of the basis on 
which You may be entitled to claim damages from IBM, (including 
fundamental breach, negligence, misrepresentation, or other contract or 
tort claim), IBM is liable for no more than 1) damages for 
bodily injury (including death) and damage to real property and 
tangible personal property and 2) the amount of any other actual 
direct damages up to the charges for the Program that is the 
subject of the claim.<br>
<br>
This limitation of liability also applies to IBM's Program 
developers and suppliers. It is the maximum for which they and IBM are 
collectively responsible.<br>
<br>
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES IS IBM, ITS PROGRAM DEVELOPERS OR 
SUPPLIERS LIABLE FOR ANY OF THE FOLLOWING, EVEN IF INFORMED OF THEIR 
POSSIBILITY: <br>
<br>
1. LOSS OF, OR DAMAGE TO, DATA;<br>
<br>
2. SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR INDIRECT DAMAGES, OR FOR ANY 
ECONOMIC CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES; OR<br>
<br>
3. LOST PROFITS, BUSINESS, REVENUE, GOODWILL, OR 
ANTICIPATED SAVINGS.<br>
<br>
SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION 
OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE 
LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.<br>
<br>
5. General<br>
<br>
1. Nothing in this Agreement affects any statutory rights 
of consumers that cannot be waived or limited by contract.<br>

2. In the event that any provision of this Agreement is 
held to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions of 
this Agreement remain in full force and effect.<br>
<br>
3. You agree to comply with all applicable export and 
import laws and regulations.<br>
<br>
4. You agree to allow IBM to store and use Your contact 
information, including names, phone numbers, and e-mail addresses, 
anywhere they do business. Such information will be processed and 
used in connection with our business relationship, and may be 
provided to contractors, Business Partners, and assignees of IBM for 
uses consistent with their collective business activities, 
including communicating with You (for example, for processing orders, 
for promotions, and for market research).<br>
<br>
5. Neither You nor IBM will bring a legal action under this 
Agreement more than two years after the cause of action arose unless 
otherwise provided by local law without the possibility of 
contractual waiver or limitation.<br>
<br>

fulfill any obligations due to causes beyond its control.<br>

third party claims against You except, as permitted by the

<br>
The warranty period is twelve months from the date of 
delivery. The limitation period for consumers in action for breach of 
warranty is the statutory period as a minimum.<br>
<br>
The warranty for an IBM Program covers the functionality of 
the Program for its normal use and the Program's conformity to 
its specifications.<br>
<br>
IBM warrants that when the Program is used in the specified 
operating environment it will conform to its specifications. IBM does 
not warrant uninterrupted or error-free operation of the 
Program or that IBM will correct all Program defects. You are 
responsible for the results obtained from the use of the Program.<br>
<br>
The warranty applies only to the unmodified portion of the 
Program.<br>
<br>
If the Program does not function as warranted during the 
warranty period and the problem cannot be resolved with information 
available. You may return the Program to the party from whom You 
acquired it and receive a refund in the amount You paid. If You 
downloaded the Program, You may contact the party from whom You 
acquired it to obtain the refund.<br>
