		<description>
			Welcome to the <b>Java Card RMI Tutorial</b>.
			It will help you build a Java Card applet with RMI support, and an
			off-card application that communicates with this applet through RMI.<br />
			Let's get started!

			param1="com.ibm.bluez.jcop.eclipse.templatewizards.rmi" />
		<description>
			Select File &gt; New &gt; Project... in the menubar at the top
			of the workbench, and choose Java Card Project from the list.<br />
			Make sure you select a configuration with the Java Card 2.2 API, as previous versions
			do not support RMI.<br /><br />
			The <b>RMI Java Card applet</b> will be choosen at the Java Card Project Template wizard and
			can't change there(press "Next" to continue).<br /><br />
			Insert your package and applet AID as HEX-String or as ASCII-String with leading "|"-sign.<br /><br />
			The result of this step are your applet class and a sample interface for this applet.

		<description>
			The RMI-Applet created with the step before is shown in the editor (if not - open the editor 
			with double click at the applet source file in the navigator or package explorer).<br />
			Modify e.g. the simple code in the "sampleMethod" and save the modified code.

		title="Start simulation for the new Java Card Applet">
		<description>
			Select your applet in the "Package Explorer" or "Navigator" view.<br />
			When your applet is selected, choose:<br />
			Run -&gt; Run As -&gt; Java Card Application.<br />
			The Eclipse launch configuration page will be displayed. Select "Java Card Application"
			and press "new" for a new configuration.<br /><br />
			The JavaCard launch configuration page will be displayed an you can choose the 
			special requirements.<br />
			<b>1)</b> Give this configuration a name.<br /><br />
			<b>2)</b> On the Target page press the "Java Card Simulation" radiobutton and select 
			"Generic JCOPv2.2" as simulation process.<br /><br />
			<b>3)</b> Switch to the "Package Upload" page and press the "Add package..." button. Select the 
			   package for upload.<br /><br />
			<b>4)</b> Open the "Install applet" dialog with double-click on the package displayed and select your applet.<br /><br />
			<b>5)</b> Press "Run" to start the simulation with automatic applet upload.

		title="Applet Communication - Start">
		<description>
			After uploading the applet you can start a card communication via the JCShell command interpreter.<br />
			<b>1)</b> Set the JCShell communication mode to tracing: <br />
			<b>/mode trace=on</b><br /><br />
			<b>2)</b> Select the applet with command: <br />
			<b>/select |&lt;applet_aid&gt;</b><br />
			where &lt;applet_aid&gt; is the given identifier from first step.<br />
			You will find the AID also in the "CAP File Properties" view - located at the JCOP Debug perspective.

		title="Applet Communication - Identify application ID">
		<description>
			Your applet was selected and now you have to identify the application ID.<br />
			The result information from previous step contains this information in a line with this prefix: "Remote ref. ID:"

	<item
		href="/com.ibm.bluez.jcop.eclipse/guide/shell/plugins/commands/rmi_method.html"
		title="Applet Communication - Declare Remote Method">
		<description>
			Declare the method "sampleMethod" from the applet as a remote JCShell method with the
			following command:<br />
			<b>-m meth_sample &lt;appl_ID&gt; sampleMethod "short(short)"</b><br />
			where "appl_ID" is the application ID from previous step and "meth_sample" the name of a 
			new JCShell variable which will contain the ID for this remote method after command execution.<br />
			You can see this new method declaration with the command:<br />
			<b>list</b>

	<item
		href="/com.ibm.bluez.jcop.eclipse/guide/shell/plugins/commands/rmi_invoke.html"
		title="Applet Communication - Execute Remote Method">
		<description>
			Now you can execute the remote method with this command:<br />
			<b>invoke -r req_result ${meth_sample} 1000</b><br />
			where "req_result" is the name of a new JCShell variable which contains the result value of this 
			remote method after command execution and "1000" is the parameter value given to the method as 4 HEX characters.
